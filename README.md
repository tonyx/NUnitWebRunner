NUnitWebRunner
==============

a simple web runner for NUnit tests. 

Can be useful when for various reason you have code that is difficult to test from outside of your application environment.

ok features:
- more icons for different result status (I managed just success, ignore, and all the rest as failure)
- selectable unit tests via checkboxes
- tests to be runned can be in another assembly
- select/browse by classes and namespace

wow features:
- see the sources
- interact with Ide
